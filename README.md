# standUpV2

<p>StandUp is my final project that I am currently working on for RefactorU. This project is used as a way for me to showcase some of my skills. In this app I utilized the MEAN stack to create both the front-end and back-end. I know there is so much more I have to learn about coding so any criticism is much appreciated.</p>
